# Exercise 7: More Printing

# Normal printing of a string
print "Mary had a little lamb."

# Print a formatted string without variables
print "Its fleece was white as %s" % "snow"
print "And everywhere that Mary went."

# Prints the string the number of times specified
print "." * 30

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "s"
end5 = "B"
end6 = "u"
end7 = "r"
end8 = "g"

# The comma concatenates the two print statements, where as no comma
# would simply print each print statement on a new line.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end3 + end4 + end3,
print end5 + end6 + end7 + end8 + end3 + end7
